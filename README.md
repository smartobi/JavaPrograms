In this tutorial we will create the most basic program in Java. i.e. Hello World Program. Since 
Java is object-oriendted, programs are organized into modules called classes, which may have data 
in variables and subroutines called methods. The only way to learn a new programming language is 
to wrie programs in it. This first program to write is the same for all languages. The Program 
below Prints the words Hello, World ,,, 
/***************************************************************************************************** 
*Compilation: javac HellowWorld.java * Execution: java HellowWorld 
*
* Prints "Hellow, World". By tradition, this is everyone's first program.
*
* % java HellowWorld
* Hello, World
*
*
******************************************************************************************************
public class HelloWorld {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, World");
}
},,,
